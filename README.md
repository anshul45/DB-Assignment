1. **The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to only one category, but a category can have multiple products associated with it.**
2. **To ensure the integrity of our product categy, we can do this using foreign keys. This approach guarantees that every product listed in the 'Product' table is appropriately linked to a valid category from the 'Product_Category' table. For example, when adding a new product, such as a cellphone. By assigning the product a category ID, like '112' for electronic devices, we validate its classification within our system.**
